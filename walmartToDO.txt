How would I get the bot to run in sequential order without adding 
an item running before the login happens?

make it return a promise and use async/await

console log my cart, items in it & total: I'll have to look through the different responses i'll probably
be able to find a good response to log in the add to cart or submit checkout. right now i'm logging 1 item but if i buy more items I won't be logging them

make the bot so that i'm not manually plugging in my crt or customer id in the body of the checkoutcart function
have to find it in the cookies and save it as a variable so that it can be used globally

for all of the customer data I need such as credit card number, address, email etc I can put all of those into a txt file and have my bot read from the text
file or put those fields into the bot and have the user input their information because maybe that might have the bot run faster (have to ask mark)
