Adding item to cart:
With cookies cleared as long as I know my CID i'm able to add an item to cart

To do:
figure out when and where the CID is generated
take the CID out of the add to cart link and try to add an item to cart and see what information I get back
If I have to be logged in to get a CID I have to figure out a way for this bot to automatically log into users accounts before I add to cart
There should be a workaround because people order things as a guest so I should be able to do that but still not sure what the best way would be

can use the PCID (which is generated and is in the cookies after you add an item to your cart) to view cart so you can use that whether your a guest or a member
and even if you're not logged in you can see your cart
