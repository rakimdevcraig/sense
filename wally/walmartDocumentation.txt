offerID

Referer:
Go under content tab and into headers
go down to "referer"

How to find info about individual product:
click the tempo?tenant=Walmart.com tab
under headers go down to "p13n"
inside of that I can see: Item availability(which I can use for a monitor), 
productName & pageID(which make up each page) page=walmart.com/ip/productName/pageID

CID:can find in the cookie in the checkout after you choose the first option for delivery before 
you confirm your delivery address
go into network and click "shipping address" tab 
in "headers" go down to cookie and look through the cookie until i find the "CID"
wherever I need to plug in the :CID remove the entire ":CID" even the colon and put in my CID

                    ***Shipping Method Rule****
if item is over $35 in the body of the submitShippingMethod function I have to 
make "shipMethod" "EXPEDITED" because walmart offers free expedited shipping for all 
orders over $35 and if the order is less I have to make "shipMethod" "STANDARD"

how to get the body of your error request if you want to look at it"
            console.log(err.response.request.body)
            
need to find out how to log just error message also so I don't have to see long error messages with a bunch of info I don't need
