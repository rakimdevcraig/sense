field i'm having trouble with is "itemids

item id comes from the previous request response at checkout view:
if i click PCID ? page = CHECKOUT_VIEW in the browser and go to preview
inside of items open item 0 and when I go down I'll see the field "id"
somehow I have to take that from this request and put it into my next one for the itemIds field 

Have to take the id field from checkout_view and put that into my body for the "submitShippingMethod" function
